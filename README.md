Complete with over 100 factory presets, CitySynth pack the power to transition from a digital orchestra to a fat bass with a scroll of the mouse wheel! With built-in MIDI and musical PC keyboard support (and don't forget the wobbly delay and reverb) you'll be suprised by the versatility at your fingertips.

And what's more, if you're a tinkerer or just know the sound you want to create off-the-bat, try hold down the Touch-key (Alt) to enable the harmonic oscillator control touchpad (below, bottom-right) and reveil the hidden controls to really dial in that signiture sound.
